## What is RBAC
-  RBAC means - Role Based Access Control.
- In General, this is used to restrict permission on the 
    - user who is using K8s to orchestrate the containers
    - resources (ex - pods or other K8s Resources) to have access on other resources

## Why Do we need that
- We dont want a melicious user with full admin role to delete or damage any resources inside the K8s Cluster
- We dont want some pod with some melicious container application has full access on the secret or other important resources
- Providing the POD read-only access to to sensitive information stored in Secrets.
- To follow the least privilege is the best policy to avoid any kind of fatel issues later
- Any request that we pass into K8s, it passes through API server & API Server ensures the request passes these 3 A
    - API Server is the main door and it checks `3As` 
    - 1st A - `Authentication` :  The user/programm is authenticated to perform the task(It generally comes through request header)
    - 2nd A - `Authorisation` : Checks if the user is authorised to do the task based on RBAC
    - 3rd A - `Admission Control` : Its a module which modifies or reject the request. & then saves to DB (`ETCD`)
- So, if the request is not authenticated & authorised, the request would be rejected by the API server.

## Comparison with AWS IAM policy and Roles
- When we apply a policy with a user, that becomes the user policy and the user gets the authorison to perform action on AWS based on the policy attached.
- Similarly, if we want one aws service like Ec2 to have some read access to another aws service like S3
- We create a Role and then assign that role to the Ec2
- This is the same concept as `"service account"` for K8s

## What are the components
- `User` Account ü•á : This is used to provide leaset privilege to the `users`
    - But, the point to be remembered, its not highly recommended to create user manually for K8s, its good to offload that to 3rdparty identity provider.
    - So, to provide the access to user level, K8s depends upon the Identity provider of the platform
    - Ex - For EKS, the user level RBAC is the IAM policy that is assigned to the IAM user who is managing the cluster
- `service account` ü•á : This is used to provide least privilege to the `K8s resources` 

- `Role` / `ClusterRole`
- `Role Binding` / `Cluster Role Binding`

    - In case of service account, we need to create role and then attach that role to a specific resource for a namespace level or cluster level
    - 1. 1st - We need to create a service Account 
    - 2. 2nd - We need to create a Role 
        - Role has 3 important `rules`
            - 1. API Group 
            - 2. Resources
            - 3. Actions - Verbs (get, post, del etc)
    - 3. 3rd - To attach the Role with the service, we need something called Role Binding

## How to manage the RBAC
![rbac-k8s](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20156dc5-3306-452b-8c60-4d3a6a9fffd6)
- 1. First create a namespace - `kubectl create namespace hello`
- 2. create a service account  - svcaccount.yml
    ```
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: ServiceAccount
        metadata:
        annotations:
            kubernetes.io/enforce-mountable-secrets: "true"
        name: my-serviceaccount
        namespace: hello
    ```
- 3. Now, apply the service account - `kubectl apply -f svcaccount.yml`
- 4. Now, need to create Role which would define the level of access - `role.yml`
    ```
        apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
        kind: Role
        metadata:
        namespace: hello
        name: user1
        rules:
        - apiGroups: ["usergroup1"]
        resources: ["*"]
        verbs: ["*"] // for all - GET, POST, DELET etc
    ```
    - here, the user has access to only one group for all resources but within the `hello` ns
- 5. Apply the role menifest on K8s - `kubectl apply -f role.yml`
- 6. Now, both service account and roles are made, but they are of no use, unless we bind them together
- 7. `RoleBind`  - rolebind.yml
    ```
        kind: RoleBinding
        apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
        metadata:
            name: dev-user-binding
        subjects:
        - kind: ServiceAccount
            name: my-serviceaccount
            apiGroup: usergroup1
        roleRef:
            kind: Role
            name: user1
        a   piGroup: usergroup1

    ```
- 8. Now, to bind the role to the service account, just apply that - `kubectl apply -f rolebind.yml`
- 9. See the role binding - `kubectl get rolebindings -A`

## What are the ways to manage users in K8s
- 1. Using 3rd party Identiyty providers and the common method are - `OAuth/OIDC Providers(eg; google, github etc)`

### 2. Create user manually using certificates (Little complex :adult:)
- To see the list of existing user on the cluster 
    - `kubectl config get-users`
    - See in details - `kubectl config view `

### 3. List the current user permission 
    - use `kubectl auth can-i <verb> <resource>`
    - `kubectl auth can-i list pods`

### 4. To List all permissions  
`kubectl-access-matrix`
- install a plugin `access-matrix`
- First Install the plugin - `kubectl krew install access-matrix`
- after install execute this - `kubectl access-matrix`

### 5. `Changing` the users : 
- To change the user, `context` switch is needed in the kubeconfig file. 
- Each context is tied to a specific user, cluster, and namespace.

**List all context**
- `kubectl config get-contexts`

**Set the Current Context**
- Switch to a different context to change the user
- `kubectl config use-context <context-name>`


    

## How to create users in Kubermnetes
* ‚úÖ 3 different files would be created in sequence
    - 1st one would be `.key` üî•
    - 2nd one would be `.csr` üî•
    - 3rd one would be `.crt` üî•
* ‚úÖ once the `.crt` is created, its the time to create role & rolebinding
* ‚úÖ Lets see things in action below 

- Get the complete info from the K8s Document - https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/certificate-signing-requests/#normal-user
- Generally, the user and user access is good to have through some 3rd party identity provider
- But, if there is a need to create a user in K8s, we have to do that in this following way

- **Remember**
    - There is no username & password for any user to connect to K8s, API server authnticate the user through the token key
- So, we have to create Key for the user

1. Generate certificate (`Private Key`) for the user `sam` using 2048 bytes using `openssl` on your local laptop
- This gives output as `sam.key`
```
openssl genrsa -out sam.key 2048
```

2. See the key - `vi sam.key `

3. Create the `CSR- Certificate Signing Request` request for the certificate  on your local laptop
- Create a CSR for the user with the Common Name (CN) set to `sam` and the Organization (O) is set to `examplegroup`.
- This gives output as `sam.csr`
```
openssl req -new -key sam.key -out sam.csr -subj "/CN=sam/O=examplegroup"

```
4. check it on your local laptop - `ls sam.*`

5. Now encode the above CSR in base 64 format - `cat sam.csr | base64 | tr -d "\n"`

- <img width="520" alt="64" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b671524f-6498-494b-89f7-4e575843cfe5">

6. Create a CertificateSigningRequest (CSR) Object in Kubernetes
- copy a CertificateSigningReques template from K8s docs. https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/certificate-signing-requests/#create-certificatessigningrequest
```
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: certificates.k8s.io/v1
kind: CertificateSigningRequest
metadata:
  name: sam   
spec:
  request: <Replace this with the output from the previous step>
  signerName: kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client
  expirationSeconds: 86400  # one day
  usages:
  - client auth
EOF

```
- <img width="922" alt="CA" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19fc85a5-7fd9-4393-9cd1-7738ed19db3b">

- üëâ Check if the CSR status - `kubectl get csr`
- It should be `Pending`

**Note** üëâ :  To Delete the CSR - `kubectl delete csr sam`

7. This will give output as `certificatesigningrequest.certificates.k8s.io/sam created`

8. Now, to move the CSR from Pending to Approve, execute the below command

```
kubectl certificate approve sam
```
- üëâ <img width="752" alt="CSR" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16a69b5d-ed63-4218-a5e1-ec8c71362db1">

9. Once its `approved`, its the time to retrieve that generated certificate (`.crt`)
- This gives output as `sam.crt`

```
kubectl get csr/sam -o jsonpath="{.status.certificate}" | base64 -d > sam.crt
```

10. Create a configuration specific to the user
```
kubectl get csr/sam -o jsonpath="{.status.certificate}" | base64 -d > sam.crt
```

```
cp ~/.kube/config sam-kube-config
```

### Add the user to kubeconfig üë®‚Äçüíª

11. Set the credentials for the user in the new kubeconfig file.
```
kubectl --kubeconfig=sam-kube-config config set-credentials sam --client-key=sam.key --client-certificate=sam.crt --embed-certs=true
```

12. Set the context for the user in the new kubeconfig file.
```
kubectl --kubeconfig=sam-kube-config config set-context sam --cluster=<Cluster-Name> --namespace=default --user=sam
```
13. Use the New kubeconfig File 
- To access the cluster as a `sam` user, we have to change the context to `sam`
```
export KUBECONFIG=sam-kube-config
kubectl config use-context sam

```


## Lets get things in action
* Create a user and give the user permission to only List the pods, but not Create or Delete the pods

- From the above the user is created, now we have to create
1. Role with rules to have only read only access to pods
2. RoleBinding

1. Create role menifest file
- `role.yml`
```
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: sam-role
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
```
- Then apply that to K8s Cluster 
- `kubectl apply -f role.yml`

2. Create role binding `rolebinding.yml`
```
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: sam-rolebinding
  namespace: default
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: sam
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: sam-role
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  
```
- Then apply that to K8s Cluster 
- `kubectl apply -f rolebinding.yml`

## Important items to note
- When we create a cluster, Kubernetes automatically creates a ServiceAccount object named default
